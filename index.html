    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Grace, a data storyteller with a background in hospitality management and hands-on experience as a cafÃ© supervisor.  
      With a natural ability to observe and empathize, Iâ€™ve transitioned into data science to understand people better through data.  
      Inspired by both logic and emotion, I seek to analyze human-centered problems and uncover meaningful insights.

    <h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently exploring project ideas that reflect both my background in hospitality 
      and my growing passion for data science. My goal is to use NLP techniques to uncover emotional patterns 
      in human language, especially in reviews, social media, or even personal writing.
      These are early-stage ideas, but they represent where I'm headed and what truly excites me.

      <h3>ðŸ§¾ Emotional Analysis in CafÃ© Reviews (Planned)</h3>
      <p>
        With years of experience in the hospitality industry, Iâ€™m especially interested in understanding 
        how guests express their feelings through reviews. This project aims to analyze online cafÃ© reviews 
        in Vancouver using sentiment analysis techniques. I hope to uncover what emotional keywords 
        drive positive or negative ratings, and how service-related comments compare to product-related ones like coffee quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Goals:</strong> Practice NLP basics, learn sentiment analysis, and visualize emotional patterns in customer feedback.

    <h3>ðŸ“Š Social Emotions in Workplace Tweets (Planned)</h3>
    <p>
      Inspired by my observations in team environments, this project will analyze tweets 
      about work-life balance and emotional labor. Using keyword extraction and time-based sentiment analysis, 
      I aim to discover how emotions fluctuate by day or topic in service-related tweets.
